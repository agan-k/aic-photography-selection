      <p>Lee Friedlander (born July 14, 1934) is an American photographer and artist.
      In the 1960s and 1970s, Friedlander evolved an influential and often imitated visual language
      of urban "social landscape," with many of his photographs including fragments of store-front
      reflections, structures framed by fences, posters and street signs.

        Friedlander was born in Aberdeen, Washington on July 14, 1934. In 1956, he 
        moved to New York City, where he photographed jazz musicians for record covers. His early work was 
        influenced by Eugène Atget, Robert Frank, and Walker Evans. In 1960, Friedlander was awarded a 
        <strong>Guggenheim Fellowship</strong> to focus on his art, and was awarded subsequent grants in 1962 and 1977. 
        Some of his most famous photographs appeared in the September 1985 Playboy, black and white nude 
        photographs of Madonna from the late 1970s. A student at the time, she was paid $25 for her 1979 set. 
        In 2009, one of the images fetched $37,500 at a <strong></strong>Christie's Art House auction.

        Working primarily with hand-held Leica 35mm cameras and black-and-white film, Friedlander's style 
        focused on the "social landscape". His photographs used detached images of urban life, store-front 
        reflections, structures framed by fences, and posters and signs all combining to capture the look of 
        modern life. In 1963, Nathan Lyons, Assistant Director and Curator of Photography at the International 
        Museum of Photography at George Eastman House mounted Friedlander's first solo exhibition. 
        Friedlander was then a key figure in curator <strong>John Szarkowski's</strong> 1967 "New Documents" exhibition, at 
        the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> in New York along with <strong>Garry Winogrand</strong> and <strong>Diane Arbus</strong>. In 1973, his 
        work was honored at the <strong>Rencontres d'Arles festival</strong> in France with the screening "Soirée américaine : 
        Judy Dater, Jack Welpott, Jerry Uelsmann, Lee Friedlander" presented by Jean-Claude Lemagny. In 1990, 
        the <strong>MacArthur Foundation</strong> awarded Friedlander a <strong>MacArthur Fellowship</strong>. In 2005, the Museum of Modern Art 
        presented a major retrospective of Friedlander's career, including nearly 400 photographs from the 
        1950s to the present; it was presented again in 2008 at the <strong>San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</strong>.
