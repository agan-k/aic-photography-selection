      <p><strong>Robert Frank</strong> (November 9, 1924 – September 9, 2019) was a Swiss photographer and documentary 
      filmmaker, who became an American binational. His most notable work, the 1958 book titled <strong>The 
      Americans</strong>, earned Frank comparisons to a modern-day de Tocqueville for his fresh and nuanced 
      outsider's view of American society. Critic <strong>Sean O'Hagan</strong>, writing in <strong>The Guardian</strong> in 2014, said 
      The Americans <em>"changed the nature of photography, what it could say and how it could say it.
      it remains perhaps the most influential photography book of the 20th century."</em> Frank later expanded 
      into film and video and experimented with manipulating photographs and photomontage.

        Frank emigrated to the United States in 1947, and secured a job in New York City as a fashion photographer 
        for <strong>Harper's Bazaar</strong>. He soon left to travel in South America and Europe. He created another hand-made book 
        of photographs that he shot in Peru, and returned to the U.S. in 1950. That year was momentous for 
        Frank, who, after meeting Edward Steichen, participated in the group show 51 American Photographers 
        at the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> (MoMA); he also married fellow artist Mary Frank née Mary Lockspeiser, 
        with whom he had two children, Andrea and Pablo.

        Though he was initially optimistic about the United States' society and culture, Frank's perspective 
        quickly changed as he confronted the fast pace of American life and what he saw as an overemphasis on 
        money. He now saw America as an often bleak and lonely place, a perspective that became evident in his 
        later photography. Frank's own dissatisfaction with the control that editors exercised over his work 
        also undoubtedly colored his experience. He continued to travel, moving his family briefly to Paris. 
        In 1953, he returned to New York and continued to work as a freelance photojournalist for magazines 
        including <strong>McCall's</strong>, <strong>Vogue</strong>, and <strong>Fortune</strong>.
        Associating with other contemporary photographers such as <strong>Saul 
        Leiter</strong> and <strong>Diane Arbus</strong>, he helped form what Jane Livingston has
        termed <strong>The New York School</strong> of photographers during the 1940s and 1950s.  
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In 1955, Frank received the further recognition that came the inclusion by
        <strong>Edward Steichen</strong> of seven his photographs in the world-touring Museum of Modern Art 
        exhibition The Family of Man that was to be seen by 9 million visitors and with a popular catalogue 
        that is still in print. Frank's contributions had been taken in Spain (of a woman kissing her 
        swaddled babe-in-arms), of a bowed old woman in Peru, a rheumy-eyed miner in Wales, and the others in 
        England and the US, including two (one atypically soft-focus) of his wife in pregnancy, and one of six 
        laughing women in the window of the White Tower Hamburger Stand on Fourteenth Street, New York City.

        Inspired by fellow Swiss Jakob Tuggener's 1943 filmic book Fabrik, Bill Brandt's The English at 
        Home (1936), and Walker Evans's American Photographs (1938), and on the recommendation of 
        Evans (a previous recipient), Alexey Brodovitch, Alexander Leiberman, Edward Steichen, and Meyer 
        Schapiro, Frank secured a <strong>Guggenheim Fellowship</strong> from the <strong>John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation</strong>
        in 1955 to travel across the United States and photograph all strata of its society. Cities he visited 
        included Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan; Savannah, Georgia; Miami Beach and St. Petersburg, Florida; 
        New Orleans, Louisiana; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Reno, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; 
        Butte, Montana; and Chicago, Illinois. He took his family along with him for part of his series of 
        road trips over the next two years, during which time he took 28,000 shots. 83 of these were selected 
        by him for publication in <strong>The Americans</strong>.
