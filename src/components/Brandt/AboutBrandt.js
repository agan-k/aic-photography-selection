        <p><strong>Bill Brandt</strong> (born Hermann Wilhelm Brandt; 2 May 1904 – 20 December 1983)[1]:14 was a British 
        photographer and photojournalist. Although born in Germany, Brandt moved to England, where he became known 
        for his images of British society for such magazine as Lilliput and Picture Post, later he made distorted 
        nudes, portraits of famous artists and landscapes. He is widely considered to be one of the most important 
        British photographers of the 20th century.

        Born in Hamburg, Germany, son of a British father and German mother, Brandt grew up during World War I, during 
        which his father, who had lived in Germany since the age of five, was interned for six months by the Germans 
        as a British citizen. Brandt later disowned his German heritage and would claim he was born in South 
        London. Shortly after the war, he contracted tuberculosis and spent much of his youth in a sanatorium in 
        Davos, Switzerland. He traveled to Vienna to undertake a course of treatment by psychoanalysis. He was, in 
        any case, pronounced cured and was taken under the wing of socialite Eugenie Schwarzwald. When Ezra Pound 
        visited the Schwarzwald residence, Brandt made his portrait. In appreciation, Pound reportedly offered Brandt 
        an introduction to Man Ray, whose Paris studio and darkroom Brandt would access in 1930.

        In 1933 Brandt moved to London and began documenting all levels of British society. This kind of documentary 
        was uncommon at that time. Brandt published two books showcasing this work, <strong>The English at Home</strong> (1936) and 
        <strong>A Night in London</strong> (1938). He was a regular contributor to magazines such as
        <strong>Lilliput</strong>, <strong>Picture Post</strong>, and <strong>Harper's Bazaar</strong>. He documented 
        the Underground bomb shelters of London during The Blitz in 1940, commissioned by the Ministry of Information.

        During World War II, Brandt concentrated on many subjects – as can be seen in his
        <strong>Camera in London</strong> (1948) but excelled in portraiture and landscape. To mark the arrival of 
        peace in 1945 he began a celebrated series of nudes. His major books from the post-war period are 
        <strong>Literary Britain</strong> (1951), and <strong>Perspective of Nudes</strong> (1961), followed by a 
        compilation of his best work, <strong>Shadow of Light</strong> (1966). Brandt became Britain's most influential 
        and internationally admired photographer of the 20th century. Many of his works have important social commentary 
        but also poetic resonance. His landscapes and nudes are dynamic, intense and powerful, often using wide-angle 
        lenses and distortion.
