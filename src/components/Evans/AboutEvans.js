      <p><strong>Walker Evans</strong> (November 3, 1903 – April 10, 1975) was an American 
      photographer and photojournalist best known for his work for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) 
      documenting the effects of the Great Depression. Much of Evans's work from the FSA period uses the 
      large-format, 8×10-inch (200×250mm) view camera. He said that his goal as a photographer was to make 
      pictures that are "literate, authoritative, transcendent". Many of his works are in the permanent collections of museums and have been the subject of 
      retrospectives at such institutions as the <strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong> and <strong>George Eastman Museum</strong>.

        In May and June 1933, Evans took photographs in Cuba on assignment for Lippincott, the publisher of 
        Carleton Beals' The Crime of Cuba (1933), a "strident account" of the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado.
        There Evans drank nightly with <strong>Ernest Hemingway</strong>, who loaned him money to extend his two-week stay an 
        additional week. His photographs documented street life, the presence of police, beggars and 
        dockworkers in rags, and other waterfront scenes. He also helped Hemingway acquire photos from 
        newspaper archives that documented some of the political violence Hemingway described in To Have and 
        Have Not (1937). Fearing that his photographs might be deemed critical of the government and 
        confiscated by Cuban authorities, he left 46 prints with Hemingway. He had no difficulties when 
        returning to the United States, and 31 of his photos appeared in Beals' book. The cache of prints 
        left with Hemingway was discovered in Havana in 2002 and exhibited at an exhibition in Key West.

        In the summer of 1936 Evans and writer <strong>James Agee</strong> were sent by <strong>Fortune </strong>
        magazine on assignment to Hale County, Alabama, for a story the magazine subsequently opted not to 
        run. In 1941, Evans's photographs and Agee's text detailing the duo's stay with three white tenant 
        families in southern Alabama during the Great Depression were published as the groundbreaking book 
        <strong>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</strong>. Its detailed account of three farming families paints a deeply 
        moving portrait of rural poverty. The critic Janet Malcolm notes that there was a contradiction 
        between a kind of anguished dissonance in Agee's prose and the quiet, magisterial beauty of Evans's 
        photographs of sharecroppers.

        Evans continued to work for the FSA until 1938. That year, an exhibition, <strong>Walker Evans: American 
        Photographs</strong>, was held at <strong>The Museum of Modern Art</strong>, New York. This was the first exhibition in the 
        museum devoted to the work of a single photographer.

        Evans was a passionate reader and writer, and in 1945 became a staff writer at <strong>Time</strong> magazine. 
        Shortly afterward he became an editor at <strong>Fortune</strong> magazine through 1965. That year, he became a 
        professor of photography on the faculty for Graphic Design at the <strong>Yale University School of Art</strong>.
