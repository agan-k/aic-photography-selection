        Koudelka was born in 1938 in the small Moravian town of Boskovice, Czechoslovakia. He began 
        photographing his family and the surroundings with a 6×6 Bakelite camera. He studied at the 
        Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT) between 1956 and 1961, receiving a degree in 
        engineering in 1961. He staged his first photographic exhibition the same year. Later he worked 
        as an aeronautical engineer in Prague and Bratislava. Koudelka began taking commissions from 
        theatre magazines, and regularly photographed stage productions at Prague's Theatre Behind the 
        Gate on a Rolleiflex camera. In 1967, he decided to give up his career in engineering for full-time 
        work as a photographer.

      He had returned from a project photographing gypsies in Romania just two days before the Soviet
      invasion, in August 1968. He witnessed and recorded the military forces of the Warsaw Pact as they
      invaded Prague and crushed reforms of the so-called Prague Spring. Koudelka's negatives were smuggled
      out of Prague to the Magnum agency, and published anonymously in The Sunday Times Magazine under the
      initials P. P. (Prague Photographer) for fear of reprisal to him and his family. Koudelka's pictures
      of the events became dramatic international symbols. In 1969 the "anonymous Czech photographer" was
      awarded the <strong>Overseas Press Club's Robert Capa Gold Medal</strong> for photographs requiring 
      exceptional courage.

      Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Koudelka sustained his work through numerous grants and awards, and
      continued to exhibit and publish major projects like Gypsies (1975) and Exiles (1988). Since 1986, he
      has worked with a panoramic camera and issued a compilation of these photographs in his book Chaos in
      1999. Koudelka has had many books of his work published, including in 2006 the retrospective volume
      Koudelka. Koudelka has won awards such as the <strong>Prix Nadar</strong> (1978), a <strong>Grand Prix
        National de la Photographie</strong> (1989), a <strong>Grand Prix Cartier-Bresson</strong> (1991), and
        the <strong>Hasselblad Foundation International Award in Photography</strong> (1992). Significant
        exhibitions of his work have been held at the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> and the
        <strong>International Center of Photography</strong>, New York; the <strong>Hayward Gallery</strong>,
        London; the <strong>Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art</strong>, Amsterdam; and the <strong>Palais de
        Tokyo</strong>, Paris.
