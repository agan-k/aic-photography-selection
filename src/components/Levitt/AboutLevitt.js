      <h2>Helen Levitt</h2>

        <p><strong>Helen Levitt</strong> (August 31, 1913 – March 29, 2009) was an American photographer. She was 
        particularly noted for street photography around New York City, and has been called <em>"the most celebrated and 
        least known photographer of her time."</em>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Levitt was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of May (Kane), who was a bookkeeper before 
        her marriage, and Sam Levitt, who ran a wholesale knit-goods business. Her father and maternal 
        grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. She dropped out of high school and in 1931 she learned how 
        to develop photos in the darkroom when she began working for J. Florian Mitchell, a commercial portrait 
        photographer in the Bronx. She saw the work of <strong>Henri Cartier-Bresson</strong>, a large influencer on her career, 
        at the Julien Levy Gallery and for the first time saw photography as art. She practiced by photographing 
        her mother’s friends with a used Voigtländer camera.

        She continued taking more street photographs mainly in East Harlem but also in the Garment District and on the 
        Lower East Side, all in Manhattan. During the 1930s to 1940s, the lack of air conditioning meant people were 
        outside more, which invested her in street photography. Her work was first published in the
        <strong>Fortune</strong> magazine's July 1939 issue.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Levitt received her first grant in 1946 from the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> in New York. In 1959 and 1960, she 
        received two grants from <strong>Guggenheim Foundation</strong> for her pioneering work in color photography. In 1965 she 
        published her first major collection, <strong>A Way of Seeing</strong>. Much of her work in color from 1959 to 1960 was stolen 
        in a 1970 burglary of her East 12th Street apartment. The remaining photos, and others taken in the following 
        years, can be seen in the 2005 book <strong>Slide Show: The Color Photographs of Helen Levitt</strong>. However, she felt 
        equally comfortable working with black and white, as she did both in the 1980s. In 1976, she was a Photography 
        Fellow of the <strong>National Endowment for the Arts</strong>.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Levitt also had a known connection with <strong>Walker Evans</strong>. In 1937 or 1938, she showed him her photographs of 
        children playing. He found interest in them, and they worked together in 1938-39, taking pictures in the 
        subway. It has been written that <em>“the only photographers Evans ‘felt had something original to say were 
        Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt and himself.’”</em>
