        <p><strong>Manuel Álvarez Bravo</strong> (February 4, 1902 – October 19, 2002) was a Mexican artistic 
        photographer and one of the most important figures in 20th century Latin American photography. 
        He was born and raised in Mexico City. While he took art classes at the Academy of San Carlos, 
        his photography is self-taught.

        Álvarez Bravo's photography career spanned from the late 1920s to the 1990s. 
        It formed in the decades after the Mexican Revolution (1920s to 1950s) when there was significant creative 
        output in the country, much of it sponsored by the government wanting to promote a new Mexican identity 
        based on both modernity and the country's indigenous past. His hallmark as a photographer was to capture 
        images of the ordinary but in ironic or Surrealistic ways. His early work was based on European influences, 
        but he was soon influenced by the Mexican muralism movement and the general cultural and political push 
        at the time to redefine Mexican identity. He rejected the picturesque, employing elements to avoid 
        stereotyping. He had numerous exhibitions of his work, worked in the Mexican cinema and established 
        Fondo Editorial de la Plástica Mexicana publishing house. He won numerous awards for his work, mostly 
        after 1970. His work was recognized by the UNESCO Memory of the World registry in 2017.
