      <p><strong>Bruce Davidson</strong> (born September 5, 1933) is an American photographer. His photographs, 
      notably those taken in Harlem, New York City, have been widely exhibited and published. He is known for photographing 
      communities usually hostile to outsiders. After his military service, in 1957, Davidson worked briefly as a 
      freelance photographer.

      In 1958, he became an associate member of the <strong>Magnum Photos</strong> agency and a full member a year 
      later.During the summer of 1959 and coincidentally only two years after the premiere of West Side Story, 
      through a social worker he made contact with homeless, troubled teenagers who called themselves the Jokers, 
      and after photographing them over 11 months produced <strong>Brooklyn Gang</strong>. Their leader was also the 
      subject of extensive interviews by Davidson's wife-to-be Emily Haas (they married in 1967), later published 
      with his photographs.

      When in 1960 <strong>Queen magazine</strong> invited him to Britain for two months, he documented the idiosyncratic
      stoicism of the natives of the islands from an American perspective.

      Through the agency in 1961 he received his first assignment to photograph high fashion for Vogue, and was assigned 
      by <strong>The New York Times</strong> to cover the Freedom Riders in the South. The Freedom Riders assignment in 
      the South led Davidson to undertake a documentary project on the civil rights movement. From 1961 to 1965, he 
      chronicled its events and effects around the country. A number were shown in the 1965 Smithsonian Institution 
      exhibition project Profile of Poverty, produced by the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in support of the 
      antipoverty programs of the 1960s. President Johnson assembled the 'White House Photography Program,' headed 
      by <strong>MoMA's John Szarkowski,</strong> through which Davidson's project was used to humanise the poor and 
      demonstrate the urgency of government action. In support of the project, Davidson received a 
      <strong>Guggenheim Fellowship</strong> in 1961, and the project was displayed in 1963 at the Museum of Modern Art 
      in New York; and curator John Szarkowski included pictures from the project in a 1966 solo exhibition, and they 
      were also included in The Negro American, a 1966 collection of essays on the status of African-Americans. Upon the 
      completion of his documentation of the civil rights movement, Davidson received the first ever photography grant 
      from the <strong>National Endowment for the Arts</strong>
