      <p><strong>Saul Leiter</strong> (December 3, 1923 – November 26, 2013) was an American photographer and painter 
        whose early work in the 1940s and 1950s was an important contribution to what came to be recognized 
        as the New York school of photography.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <strong>Pousette-Dart</strong> and <strong>W. Eugene Smith</strong> encouraged Leiter to pursue photography and he was soon taking 
        black and white pictures with a 35mm Leica, which he acquired for a few Eugene Smith prints. In 
        1948, he started taking color photographs. He began associating with other contemporary 
        photographers such as <strong>Robert Frank</strong> and <strong>Diane Arbus</strong> and helped form what Jane Livingston has termed 
        the New York School of photographers during the 1940s and 1950s.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Leiter worked as a fashion photographer for the next 20 years and was published in <strong>Show</strong>, <strong>Elle</strong>, 
        <strong>British Vogue</strong>, <strong>Queen</strong>, and <strong>Nova</strong>. In the late 1950s the art director <strong>Henry Wolf</strong> published Leiter’s 
        color fashion work in <strong>Esquire</strong> and later in <strong>Harper’s Bazaar</strong>.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <strong>Edward Steichen</strong> included Leiter’s black and white photographs in the exhibition <strong>Always the Young 
        Stranger</strong> at the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> in 1953. Leiter’s work is featured prominently in <strong>Jane 
        Livingston’s</strong> book <strong>The New York School</strong> (1992) and in Martin Harrison’s Appearances: Fashion 
        Photography since 1945 (1991). In 2008, <strong>The Foundation Henri Cartier-Bresson</strong> in Paris mounted 
        Leiter’s first museum exhibition in Europe with an accompanying catalog.

        Leiter is the subject of a 2012 feature-length documentary <strong>In No Great Hurry - 13 Lessons in Life 
        with Saul Leiter</strong>, directed and produced by Tomas Leach. Leiter is a featured subject, among 
        others, in the documentary film <strong>Tracing Outlines</strong> (2015) by 2nd State Productions.

        <strong>Martin Harrison</strong>, editor and author of Saul Leiter Early Color (2006), writes, <em>"Leiter’s 
        sensibility . . . placed him outside the visceral confrontations with urban anxiety associated with 
        photographers such as Robert Frank or William Klein. Instead, for him the camera provided an 
        alternate way of seeing, of framing events and interpreting reality. He sought out moments of quiet 
        humanity in the Manhattan maelstrom, forging a unique urban pastoral from the most unlikely of 
        circumstances."</em>
