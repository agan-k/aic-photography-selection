        <p><strong>Lisette Model</strong> (born Elise Amelie Felicie Stern; November 10, 1901 – March 30, 1983) was an 
        Austrian-born American photographer primarily known for the frank humanism of her street photography. A prolific 
        photographer in the 1940s and a member of the New-York cooperative <strong>Photo League</strong>, she was 
        published in <strong>PM’s Weekly</strong>, <strong>Harper’s Bazaar</strong>, <strong>US Camera</strong> 
        before taking up teaching in 1949 through the intermediary of <strong>Ansel Adams</strong>. She continued to 
        photograph and taught at the New School for Social Research in New York from 1951 up until her death in 1983 
        with many notable students, the most famous of whom was <strong>Diane Arbus</strong>. Her work has been shown 
        in numerous exhibitions and still resides in several permanent collections, including that of the 
        <strong>National Gallery of Canada</strong> and the <strong>J. Paul Getty Museum</strong>.

        In 1937 Lisette married the Russian painter Evsa Model. The following year they moved to New York, where 
        they were to remain for the rest of their lives. Lisette's talents as a photographer were greeted 
        enthusiastically by art directors such as <strong>Ralph Steiner </strong>of PM's Weekly and
        <strong>Alexey Brodovitch</strong> of Harper's Bazaar. With Brodovitch's endorsement Lisette worked on 
        assignment for Harper's Bazaar from 1943 to 1955. It was during this period that she produced some of her 
        most memorable images.

        Lisette Model's legacy goes beyond her own achievement as a photographer. From 1949 right up until her death 
        in 1983 she shared her love of photography with countless students from around the world. Her forthright 
        manner and uncompromising approach to her art inspired many disciples, among them Diane Arbus, Larry Fink, 
        Rosalind Solomon, and Bruce Weber
        Almost fifty years ago, the critic Elizabeth McCausland wrote most perceptively of Model: <em>Here is a woman 
        who operates almost purely by intuition. It is as if, in the camera, she had substituted her own uncovered 
        nerves and emotions for light-sensitive gelatin emulsion; as if experience had burned itself into her retina 
        as indelibly as the photographic image is embedded in silver particles.</em>
