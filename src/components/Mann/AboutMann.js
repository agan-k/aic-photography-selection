        <p><strong>Sally Mann</strong> (born May 1, 1951) is an American photographer, widely known for her 
        large-format, black-and-white photographsâ€”at first of her young children, then later of landscapes suggesting 
        decay and death.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Born in Lexington, Virginia, Mann was the third of three children. Her father, Robert S. Munger, was a 
        general practitioner, and her mother, Elizabeth Evans Munger, ran the bookstore at Washington and Lee 
        University in Lexington. Mann was raised by an atheist and compassionate father who allowed Mann to be 
        "benignly neglected". Mann was introduced to photography by her father, who encouraged her interest in 
        photography; his 5x7 camera became the basis of her use of large format cameras today. Mann began to 
        photograph when she was sixteen. Most of her photographs and writings are tied to Lexington, Virginia. 
        Mann graduated from The Putney School in 1969, and attended Bennington College and Friends World College. 
        She earned a BA, summa cum laude, from Hollins College (now Hollins University) in 1974 and a MA in creative 
        writing in 1975. She took up photography at Putney where, she claims, her motive was to be alone in the 
        darkroom with her boyfriend. She made her photographic debut at Putney with an image of a nude classmate. 
        Mann has never had any formal training in photography and she "never read about photography".

        Her works are included in the permanent collections of the <strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong>, the 
        <strong>National Gallery of Art</strong>, the <strong>Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden</strong>, the 
        <strong>Museum of Fine Arts,</strong> in Boston, the <strong>San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</strong>, 
        and the <strong>Whitney Museum</strong> of New York City among many others.

        <strong>Time</strong> magazine named Mann "America's Best Photographer" in 2001. Photos she took have appeared on the cover 
        of <strong>The New York Times Magazine</strong> twice: first, a picture of her three children for the September 27, 
        1992 issue with a feature article on her "disturbing work" and again on September 9. 2001, with a 
        self-portrait (which also included her two daughters) for a theme issue on "Women Looking at Women".
           
        Mann received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Corcoran College of Art + Design in May 2006. 
        <strong>The Royal Photographic Society</strong> (UK) awarded her an Honorary Fellowship in 2012. She won the 2016 <strong>Andrew 
        Carnegie Medal</strong> for Excellence in Nonfiction for Hold Still: A Memoir in Photographs.
