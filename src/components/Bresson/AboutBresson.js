      <h2>Henri Cartier-Bresson</h2>
      <img src={henri} />
      <p><strong>Henri Cartier-Bresson</strong> (August 22, 1908 – August 3, 2004) was a French 
      humanist photographer considered a master of candid photography, and an early user of 35mm film. 
      He pioneered the genre of street photography, and viewed photography as capturing a decisive moment.
      Cartier-Bresson was one of the founding members of <strong>Magnum Photos</strong> in 1947.

        Cartier-Bresson was introduced to oil painting by his uncle Louis, a 
        gifted painter. But the painting lessons were cut short when uncle Louis was killed in World War I.
In 1927 Cartier-Bresson entered a private art school and the Lhote Academy, the Parisian studio of the Cubist 
painter and sculptor André Lhote. Lhote's ambition was to integrate the Cubists' approach to reality with 
classical artistic forms; he wanted to link the French classical tradition of Nicolas Poussin and 
Jacques-Louis David to Modernism. Cartier-Bresson also studied painting with society portraitist Jacques 
Émile Blanche. During this period, he read Dostoevsky, Schopenhauer, Rimbaud, Nietzsche, Mallarmé, Freud, 
Proust, Joyce, Hegel, Engels and Marx. Lhote took his pupils to the Louvre to study classical artists and 
to Paris galleries to study contemporary art. Cartier-Bresson's interest in modern art was combined with an 
admiration for the works of the Renaissance masters: Jan van Eyck, Paolo Uccello, Masaccio, Piero della 
Francesca. Cartier-Bresson regarded Lhote as his teacher of "photography without a camera."

        In early 1947, Cartier-Bresson, with <strong>Robert Capa</strong>, <strong>David Seymour</strong>, <strong>William Vandivert</strong> and
          <strong> George Rodger</strong> founded Magnum Photos. Capa's brainchild, Magnum was a cooperative picture agency owned by its 
        members. The team split photo assignments among the members. Rodger, who had quit Life in London 
        after covering World War II, would cover Africa and the Middle East. Chim, who spoke a variety of 
        European languages, would work in Europe. Cartier-Bresson would be assigned to India and China. 
        Vandivert, who had also left Life, would work in America, and Capa would work anywhere that had an 
        assignment. Maria Eisner managed the Paris office and Rita Vandivert, Vandivert's wife, managed the 
        New York office and became Magnum's first president.
