      <p><strong>Diane Arbus</strong> (March 14, 1923 – July 26, 1971) was an
        American photographer. Arbus worked to normalize marginalized groups and
        highlight the importance of proper representation of all people. She
        worked with a wide range of subjects including members of the LGBTQ+
        community, strippers, carnival performers, nudists, dwarves, children,
        mothers, couples, elderly people, and middle-class families. She
        photographed her subjects in familiar settings: their homes, on the
        street, in the workplace, in the park. “She is noted for expanding
        notions of acceptable subject matter and violates canons of the
        appropriate distance between photographer and subject. By befriending,
        not objectifying her subjects, she was able to capture in her work a
        rare psychological intensity”. In his 2003 New <strong>York Times Magazine</strong>
        article, "Arbus Reconsidered," <strong>Arthur Lubow</strong> states, <em>"She was fascinated
        by people who were visibly creating their own identities—cross-dressers,
        nudists, sideshow performers, tattooed men, the nouveau riche, the
        movie-star fans—and by those who were trapped in a uniform that no
        longer provided any security or comfort."</em> <strong>Michael Kimmelman</strong> writes in
        his review of the exhibition Diane Arbus Revelations, <em>"Her memorable
        work, which she did, on the whole, not for hire but for herself, was all
        about heart—a ferocious, audacious heart. It transformed the art of
        photography (Arbus is everywhere, for better and worse, in the work of
        artists today who make photographs), and it lent a fresh dignity to the
        forgotten and neglected people in whom she invested so much of herself."</em>

        In her lifetime she achieved some recognition and renown with the
        publication, beginning in 1960, of photographs in such magazines as
        <strong>Esquire, Harper’s Bazaar</strong>, London's <strong>Sunday Times Magazine</strong>, and <strong>Artforum</strong>.
        In 1963 the <strong></strong>Guggenheim Foundation awarded Arbus a fellowship for her
        proposal entitled, "American Rites, Manners and Customs". She was
        awarded a renewal of her fellowship in 1966. <strong>John Szarkowski</strong>, the
        director of photography at the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong> (MoMA) in New York
        City from 1962 to 1991, championed her work and included it in his 1967
        exhibit New Documents along with the work of Lee Friedlander and Garry
        Winogrand. Her photographs were also included in a number of other major
        group shows.

        The first major retrospective of Arbus' work was held in 1972 at MoMA,
        organized by Szarkowski. The retrospective garnered the highest
        attendance of any exhibition in MoMA's history to date. Millions
        viewed traveling exhibitions of her work from 1972 to 1979. The book
        accompanying the exhibition, Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph, edited
        by Doon Arbus and Marvin Israel and first published in 1972 has never
        been out of print.
